### Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry

# Description #
### Research Goal & Requirements ###
This project is aimed to support musicians in learning new songs, particularly through the use of chord sheets and guitar tabs. Musicians are always learning new music, and chord sheets serve as a way for the musician to have a basis to start learning songs that they are interested in so that they don't have to work off of nothing and/or just by ear if that is not their preferred way of learning. They are also helpful for when musicians are gigging and spontaneously decide to play a song; the chord sheets make it so that it's very easy to play a song together for the first time. These sites should be simple and aesthetic while maximizing functionality to simplify and streamline the process of learning a song, since the intention is to make this activity as convenient for the user as possible.

Learning music involves a person's esteem needs and cognitive needs. A person's desire for creativity and meaning might result in a motivation to learn music in pursuit of creative and artistic fulfillment. Simultaneously, this drive and passion for music might give them meaning, as well as funnel into their feelings of self-confidence and freedom. Traditionally, without chord sheets and tabs, musicians would have to listen to the song and figure out the chords by ear. However, learning by ear and tonal memory is not every musician's strength and/or learning preference, and having the chords written out for them makes it not only easier for them to accelerate the improvisation and arranging process if they desire to do so, but it also just provides another method for people to learn music. Online resources also make it so that learning music is more accessible to people for a low cost, or even no cost at all, from the comfort of their own home or anywhere they want to take it.

### Target Users ### 
The users in question are musicians and/or aspiring musicians who either prefer to learn music through chord sheets and/or tabs, or gig and play covers often. They might have varying levels of background knowledge in music, and their expertise might range anywhere between a complete amateur and even a professional (in the instance of the gigging musicians). They can do this virtually anywhere; they might learn songs while they're just jamming at home for fun, as a personal creative goal, or when they're on stage or performing somewhere. They would usually practice in advance and learn the music by ear, but having the skeleton of the music ready for them and put online by others in advance puts them one step ahead. 

### Method ### 
The research shall be conducted through participatory interaction. An interview shall be conducted in which the participant answers a series of questions and completes some activities. The participant shall be observed in the process in order to hopefully gauge their authentic reactions and gain a better understanding, as well as new insight, of the user perspective. 

The interview shall take place remotely over Zoom. The user's screen shall be shared, and both their screen and their voice shall be recorded as they respond to questions and complete tasks in order to collect data and monitor their activity. The collected data shall later be used for analytical purposes.
