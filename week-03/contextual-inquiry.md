### Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry

# Description #
### Research Goal & Requirements ###
This project is aimed to support musicians in learning new songs, particularly through the use of chord sheets and guitar tabs. Musicians are always learning new music, and chord sheets serve as a way for the musician to have a basis to start learning songs that they are interested in so that they don't have to work off of nothing and/or just by ear if that is not their preferred way of learning. They are also helpful for when musicians are gigging and spontaneously decide to play a song; the chord sheets make it so that it's very easy to play a song together for the first time. These sites should be simple and aesthetic while maximizing functionality to simplify and streamline the process of learning a song, since the intention is to make this activity as convenient for the user as possible.

Learning music involves a person's esteem needs and cognitive needs. A person's desire for creativity and meaning might result in a motivation to learn music in pursuit of creative and artistic fulfillment. Simultaneously, this drive and passion for music might give them meaning, as well as funnel into their feelings of self-confidence and freedom. Traditionally, without chord sheets and tabs, musicians would have to listen to the song and figure out the chords by ear. However, learning by ear and tonal memory is not every musician's strength and/or learning preference, and having the chords written out for them makes it not only easier for them to accelerate the improvisation and arranging process if they desire to do so, but it also just provides another method for people to learn music. Online resources also make it so that learning music is more accessible to people for a low cost, or even no cost at all, from the comfort of their own home or anywhere they want to take it.

### Target Users ### 
The users in question are musicians and/or aspiring musicians who either prefer to learn music through chord sheets and/or tabs, or gig and play covers often. They might have varying levels of background knowledge in music, and their expertise might range anywhere between a complete amateur and even a professional (in the instance of the gigging musicians). They can do this virtually anywhere; they might learn songs while they're just jamming at home for fun, as a personal creative goal, or when they're on stage or performing somewhere. They would usually practice in advance and learn the music by ear, but having the skeleton of the music ready for them and put online by others in advance puts them one step ahead. 

### Method ### 
The research shall be conducted through participatory interaction. An interview shall be conducted in which the participant answers a series of questions and completes some activities. The participant shall be observed in the process in order to hopefully gauge their authentic reactions and gain a better understanding, as well as new insight, of the user perspective. 

The interview shall take place remotely over Zoom. The user's screen shall be shared, and both their screen and their voice shall be recorded as they respond to questions and complete tasks in order to collect data and monitor their activity. The collected data shall later be used for analytical purposes.

# Reflection #
I was able to learn a lot from this interview. In terms of the technical aspects, this interview went much more smoothly in comparison to the pilot UT; there were no connection issues and it was very easy to understand what the participant was saying at all times. 30 minutes were allotted for the interview to be conducted, and the participant was very thorough in his responses, so the resulting interview did end up being around 30 minutes long. Funnily enough (and completely unintentionally), the two sites that the participant ended up using to demonstrate his music learning process were the two sites used for the intiial heuristic evaluation. It was really interesting to see that there was a lot of useful information that could be learned from this kind of contextual inquiry, and even though the contents of the meeting with the participant was a lot less specific than the content of the usability testing, there were still both lots of different things to learn as well as factors previously identified in the initial heuristic evaluation that came up again. Aside from the interviewing process itself, the transcript editing took a lot more time than I expected it to, although the auto-transcript software was extremely helpful. I don't even want to think about how long it would have taken without it.

From the participant's responses, there are a few things that should be prioritized when improving the usability of Ultimate Guitar: simplicity, accessibility of learning (rather than limiting the chord sheets to be chord sheets alone), and open access. All of these come before working on the profit model of the website, because without an appealing 'Lite' version of the website, the 'Pro' version will not be successful. Some insights from the interview are as follows:

### Futher assessment of severity of issues: ###
- Ads should not be obstructing use of the site to limit clutter.
- Difficulty ratings should be easily viewable, and should also be standardized in some way.
- The process of viewing different versions of a song should be streamlined.

### New suggestions identified: ###
- Functionality that allows the MIDI of a song to be played back should be added to improve music learning capabilities.
- Both site usage and lyrics should be made available in different languages.
- The tab revision process should be simple and evident to the user.
