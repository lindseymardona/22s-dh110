### Assignment 07: High-Fidelity Prototype

# Description #
At the most basic level, a prototype is simply an expression of how a design is intended to materialize. The purpose of a high-fidelity prototype is to combine the structure of the [low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-05/lowfidelityprototype.md) with the [interface design](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-06/interfacedesign.md) in order to visualize both the informative and interactive components of the prototype for design purposes, as well as validify the interaction flow of user choices. Through a process of revisions and feedback, a polished design shall be produced. 

The tasks for the high-fidelity prototype are derivwed from the [personas + usage scenarios](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-04/persona.md).

Thus, the tasks and features that have been selected for this low fidelity prototype are as follows:</br></br>
**Task 1** </br>
- Use the search bart to search for a song
- Filter for the 'easy' version of difficulty of the tablature from the sidebar
- Select the tablature for "Happier" by Ed Sheeran
- Switch between the tablature and a chord sheet

**Task 2**</br>
- Access the 'Shots' page
- Access the 'Help' window
- Access and click through the interactive tutorial for how to use the 'Shots' page

# Task Flows #

# Cognitive Walkthrough #
A cognitive walkthrough was performed in order to check the clarity of the interaction flow.
The evidence for the cognitive walkthrough can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12yOpcXmBWoEWWdrIUuy7uShqwW7C-VQ8SSxFVydRpu8/edit).

## Summary of Findings ##
The feedback I received from the cognitive walkthrough (which was conducted remotely) did not go as smoothly as I hoped it would. To elaborate, the Ultimate Guitar website is intended to be somewhat of a crowdsourced database of tablature as opposed to a website that primarily serves as a tutorial website. For this reason, the target audience is moreso people who have already started to learn how to play their instrument and are looking for music to learn, not the very basics. Unfortunately, I think that this was misunderstood by the person who conducted the cognitive walkthrough on my site, affecting the feedback in a way that I cannot derive much from other than trying to figure out a way to make the website's purpose clearer. It might be worth considering renaming some of the original menu labels which were simply derived from the site for clarity purposes; however, this loses the unique and branded aspect. Furthermore in regard to the database of songs, my reviewer suggested having the search results appear as buttons rather than links. However, I personally think that this might look archaic and/or cluttered. A middle ground for a future revision would perhaps be to create panels of rounded rectangles with backgrounds and/or outlines that also contain the search results, similar to Reddit.
