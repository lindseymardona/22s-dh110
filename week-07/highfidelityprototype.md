# Reflection #
Although it was tedious, I enjoyed thinking about how to design the wireframes effectively, particularly in order to address my goals of simplicity without clutter in order to have an interface that is welcoming to users who are not familiar with music and/or technology. I made additions and revisions to my wireframes several times throughout the process as I realized what needed to be implemented to better accomplish my prototype goals. I felt like this type of website was particularly challenging to design the low fidelity prototypes for in comparison to a music learning phone application, namely because with those kinds of applications, a lot of people can fall back on using a log in/sign up and introductory survey functionality to design. On the other hand, as also noted in the [user testing](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-03/contextual-inquiry.md), it's ideal to avoid a log in/sign up functionality for websites (and subsequently, a survey for user recommendation optimization), because people don't want to have to go through those steps simply in order to use the website.

I also realized after finishing that I could have added one more wireflow path, with clicking the "Ultimate Guitar" in the top left corner bringing the user back to the homepage.

The feedback I got from the wireflow test as well as how I would address it in a prototype revision is as follows:

**Feedback** | **Revision** 
-------------|--------------------
Organize artists by alphabetical order | Add sorting functionalities for search results (e.g. relevance, alphabetical, newest, etc.)
Functinoality to close "help" window should be implemented | Make it clearer as to how to close the "help" window as opposed to clicking outside of the box
Implement way to close tutorial while in progress | Add an overlayed X button to exit the tutorial in the top right corner of the grayed out screen
