### Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

# Description #
At the most basic level, a prototype is simply an expression of how a design is intended to materialize. Building upon this, a low-fidelity prototype is a version of this expression in which the design elements are secondary to the most important and functional aspects of the design. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is create a low-fidelity prototype in order to begin conceptualizing how the user would interact with the redesigned website. This shall be done by sketching detailed wireframes, then using them to create a wireflow as an initial prototype. The information collected from testing this low-fidelity prototype will hopefully provide insight into the effectiveness of the prototype, as well as what areas still need improvement.
