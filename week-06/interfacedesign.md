### Assignment 06: Interface Design

# Description #
Ultimate Guitar is a music-learning website which focuses on tablature and chordsheets. While the site can be extremely helpful for musicians of various levels of expertise, past assessments including the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-01/heuristic-evaluation.md) and [usability testing](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-02/usability-testing.md) have raised the issue of certain shortcomings in interface design and usability. In order to address the conclusions drawn from these evaluations, a [low fidelity prototype](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-05/lowfidelityprototype.md) was developed to express an initial intent of how the design may be materialized.

# Process and Purpose #
Based on the drafted layout from the [low fidelity prototype](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-05/lowfidelityprototype.md), Figma shall be used in order to create several mock ups of the proposed interface design. In addition, Spark shall be used for usability testing, namely color contrast checking. Finally, an impression test shall be conducted in order to determine if the look and feel of the project fit the intention of the project, as well as receive any feedback on how to improve the interface design.

At this stage of the process, the objective shall be to create and test possible design ideas for the interface, which will later be used for the high fidelity prototype. This shall be done while prioritizing usability concerns and the presentation of information. By proposing several different variations of the design, the strengths and weaknesses of each design can be reasoned through, and ultimately result in the final design.
