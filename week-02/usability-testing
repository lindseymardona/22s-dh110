### Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Test

# Introduction #
Ultimate Guitar is a website where users can submit chord sheets, guitar tabs, ukelele tabs, bass tabs, and more. In addition to its main feature, it also offers additional functionalities for musicians and users to enjoy. The Shots feature allows users to submit videos of themselves playing. The Courses feature is a place for users to access and purchase published courses. The Articles feature is a place where music-related news is submitted. Finally, the Forums feature is where musicians can meet, interact, and hold discussion about any topic of their interest. The site does not require the user to sign up to be able to use it; however, additional functionality such as favoriting tabs is enabled when the user does create an account.

After conducting a [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/heuristics/evaluation.md) of the website, there were several usability problems identified of various severity ratings. The usability problems identified were as follows:
- Hard to tell where the user is currently on the site
- Tab Catalog minimizes all other tabs when one is selected
- Certain pages ("Publish Tab", "Pro") open into completely separate webpage structures that don't offer a way back to the main site
- Shots background is inconsistent
- Subscription-locked functionality is not indicated as such
- "Shots" page does not provide a place to submit shots
- "Shots" page scroll functionality is confusing
- Ad placement is cluttered
- Colorscheme is not aesthetic
- "Forums" page is cluttered and old-fashioned
- Information about each page is missing
- Documentation about nonintuitive pages (particularly "Forums") lacks documentation

From there, the problems selected to focus on were narrowed down to three. The severity of these problems shall be further evaluated in a pilot usability test, as well as the general effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the website. The first task shall be intended to evaluate the efficiency of day-to-day use of the 'Tabs' feature in particular. This task shall exercise use of the intuitiveness and clarity of both the navigational functions and the tab information available. The second task shall be intended to evaluate the clarity of functionality of the 'Forums' page, as well as practical navigation of this page. This page is described to be cluttered, old-fashioned, and nonintuitive, according to the heuristic evaluation. Finally, the third task shall be intended to evaluate the efficiency and clarity of the structure of the 'Shots' page, which according to the heuristic evaluation, has room for improvement aesthetically and also may be confusing to navigate the functionality of.

The purpose of usability testing is evaluate how actual users may interact with a website or application and use this information in order to make changes to improve usability (defined as the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of usage). By evaluating the website/application from the user's perspective, further evaluation can be conducted in regard to the severity of problems previously identified in the heuristic evaluation (and adjustments can be made as necessary, according to the user's reaction), general issues in an average user's experience can be discovered that may not necessarily be obvious in the heuristic evaluation, and strides can be taken toward the implementation of practical changes to improve the user experience.

# Method #
This is a pilot trial; it is intended to test the setting, materials, and website in order to improve the usability testing process. The pilot usability test shall be conducted in a remote setting, with a minimalist portable test lab. The participant shall be situated in a quiet testing environment, with access to a computer to access the site and testing form, and a webcam to record participant expressions and reactions. Zoom, a videotelephony software program developed by Zoom Video Communications, shall be used in order to allow the moderator to remotely guide the participant through the orientation, informed consent, and questionnaires. The participant shall share their screen so that they may be observed as they walk through the tasks assigned to them, and the meeting shall be be recorded for analysis. 

The moderator shall introduce the materials by walking the participant through the orientation script and informed consent. After providing their signature, the participant shall then move onto the pre-test questionnaire, where they will indicate their familiarity with the website being evaluated. From there, the participant shall be assigned three tasks to navigate. Each task is broken down into steps, which the participant shall talk through as they attempt to complete them. The participant shall indicate their completion of intermediate steps in the questionnaire as they progress. After the conclusion of the tasks, the participant shall then answer a series of post-test questions that assess and measure the participant's thoughts and levels of satisfaction as they used the website to complete the tasks. The answers to these questions shall be intended to represent the participant's attitudes about aspects of the website including ease of use, efficiency of use, and consistency. Finally, the questionnaire shall conclude with a set of demographic questions for the participant to answer. These demographic questions shall remain confidential.

# Reflection #
The pilot test was conducted relatively painlessly; the conversation ran smoothly and the participant had no issues setting up the testing environment. The participant did a good job of explaining his thought process as he navigated the site. However, because of low bandwith and connection issues, there were occasionally times where the audio from the participant's side was lagging. If anything was not comprehensible, then the moderator simply asked the participant to repeat himself. However, the testing environment would be more ideal if connection issues wcould be minimized.

The tasks also did not take the expected 20 minutes; the participant provided feedback that the tasks were sufficiently thorough and the shorter task completion time can likely be attributed to individual differences in comfort and experience with technology. Because of a lack of resources, the pilot UT was conducted with a male-identifying young adult; however, if this test were to be reconducted in the target demographic (middle-aged men) it is extremely likely that the testing time would fall closer to the expected 20-30 minutes. 

A couple typos were also caught on the testing material during the testing session in the section for Task 01, which were later corrected.

The participant reactions and feedback during the testing were helpful in both identifying new issues and confirming the severity of certain problems previously identified in the heuristic evaluation. The participant expressed sentiments about the interface of the landing page being slightly intimidating and untrustworthy, and he also had some negative sentiments in the post-test questionnaire about his satisfaction with the website as he used it to carry out tasks. In addition, conclusions about specific issues being tested were drawn through observation of the participant's navigation of the website. The summary of task-specific conclusions is as follows:

**Task** | **Conclusions** 
-----------|--------------------
01 | New issue identified: The participant was able to easily find the user rating for tabs, but not the difficulty rating. The star rating displayed when searching tabs is a user-submitted satisfaction rating. There is no easy access or indication of tab difficulty when browsing tabs, which is often a helpful filtering tool when using a music-learning website/application.
02 | Futher assessment of severity of issue: The user expected the functionality to request a new tab to be in the "Tabs" section; rather, it was located in the "Forums" section. There is no indication of where to go to request a tab to be created if a user cannot find a certain tab. There should be information and/or a hotlink for this feature located in the "Tabs" section. The participant confirmed through his own sentiments that the interface for Forums was intimidating and nonintuitive for users who have never navigated a forum before, which may also be a problem when a user simply wants to request a tab rather than participate in discussions with other users. 
03 | Futher assessment of severity of issue: The participant was unable to complete the task in which they were requested to locate where to upload their own videos. The "Shots" tab should provide the option to submit a user's own videos; the current only way to do so is through the home page. The participant also had to try a few things before successfully completing the task in which they were asked to scroll through the "Shots" section; scrolling through "Shots" is not immediately intuitive, and so there were a few hiccups in the process.

My personal takeaway from the pilot UT is that UT is done by users, for users. Every small thing is crucial to identifying where improvements can be made; for example, where users think a feature may be located at first is significant, and at what times users struggle to locate certain things (regardless of if they are able to find what they are looking for at the end of the day) is also important. Adding more tasks might be helpful in providing a more well-rounded insight on the usability of the site; however, for the purpose of this project, certain tasks and usability issues were prioritized for testing. As a moderator, I would like to be more affirmative as the user goes through tasks; there should be a balance between letting the user execute their tasks without interfering with their flow and still being a kind and encouraging moderator.
