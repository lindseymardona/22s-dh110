### Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

# Project Description #
The goal of the quarter is to walk through the human centered design process with an emphasis in music and learning-related applications for middle-aged men. I believe that the opportunity to learn music should be something that is more openly available, and with online resources, this task becomes much easier. My intended focus is sites that enable musicians to learn songs more quickly and easily, such as sheet music sites and guitar tab sites. My objective is to explore possible ways to improve these available resources not only to maximize usability for users with varying levels of comfort with technology, but in an aesthetically pleasing way as well.
