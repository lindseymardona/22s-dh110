### Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

# Project Description #
The goal of the quarter is to walk through the human centered design process with an emphasis in music and learning-related applications for middle-aged men. I believe that the opportunity to learn music should be something that is more openly available, and with online resources, this task becomes much easier. My intended focus is sites that enable musicians to learn songs more quickly and easily, such as sheet music sites and guitar tab sites. My objective is to explore possible ways to improve these available resources not only to maximize usability for users with varying levels of comfort with technology, but in an aesthetically pleasing way as well.

## About ##
Ultimate Guitar is a website where users can submit chord sheets, guitar tabs, ukelele tabs, bass tabs, and more. In addition to its main feature, it also offers additional functionalities for musicians and users to enjoy. The *Shots* feature allows users to submit videos of themselves playing. The *Courses* feature is a place for users to access and purchase published courses. The *Articles* feature is a place where music-related news is submitted. Finally, the *Forums* feature is where musicians can meet, interact, and hold discussion about any topic of their interest.

## Initial Overall Evaluation ##
At first glance, the site has its strengths and weaknesses. The simple interface makes it mostly pretty easy to navigate, and the tab pages are very straightforward. Visually, however, the clutter of ad placement on the landing page and the bright yellow accent color look slightly intimidating and somewhat oudated. The *Shots* page could benefit from scrolling functionality, and it also doesn't look cohesive to the rest of the site because of the blurred background. There can be more clarity in regard to which features require payment or a pro membership in order to access them. There should also be easier user access to understanding certain areas themselves, like the difference between each type of tab in the catalog, and redirects to how to read the tabs themselves for beginners. 

## Usability Problems: Severity Scale ##

-----------|--------------------
1 | Little to no usability issues
2 | Minor usability issues (low-medium priority)
3 | Major usability issues (high priority)

## Heuristic Evaluation ##
**Heuristic & Description** | **Severity Rating** | **Evaluation** | **Recommendations** 
----------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------------
**1. Visibility of system status:** The current state of the system should be clearly communicated to users. The system response should be timely. | 2 | (+) Transitions between tabs are quick with no special effects. <br/>(-) It is a little bit hard to tell where the user currently is on the site. | Highlight the tab that the user is currently accessing. Add a path at the top of the page (e.g. "Tabs -> Chords -> Ed Sheeran -> Perfect (ver 7)").
**2. Match between system and the real world:** | 3 | stinky | deez
**3. User control and freedom:** | 3 | stinky | deez
**4. Consistency and standards:** | 3 | stinky | deez
**5. Error prevention:** | 3 | stinky | deez
**6. Recognition rather than recall:** | 3 | stinky | deez
**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Allow for use of shortcuts to maximize efficiency of use, and provide personalized content to maximize functionality for the individual. | 1 | (+) Tabs have visible "Edit", "Add To Playlist", and "Favorite" options that also stay at the top when scrolling down to provide ease of access. There is also an option to "Download PDF" at the top. The header links to the official tab, backing track, and Tonebridge, and the sidebar lists more user-submitted versions/variations of the tabs in order to smoothly and conveniently navigate between all of them instead of having to go back or perform new searches every time. The home page displays a list of "Top Tabs", both for "Today" and "All-time". There is a place on the home page for "Recently Viewed" to easily go back to any recent tabs the user was looking at, and there is a "#WhatsUp" section that shows "Hot" and "New" threads in the Forums. | Add a user-specific recommendation tab.
**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Any unnecessary information and/or elements should be ommitted. | 1 | (+) The interface is very simple and easy to navigate. <br/>(-) The ad placement is distracting. The colorscheme could be more visually appealing. | Room for cosmetic improvement.
**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Error messages should be clear and communicate to the user what went wrong and how to fix it. | 1 | (+) Search bar shows results for corrected typos when nothing  is found, and also tells the user when nothing is relevant. Anything subscription-locked communicates that it requires a Pro membership very clearly. | Room for cosmetic improvement.
**10. Help and documentation:** Additional instructions, if necessary, should be both comprehensible and easily accessible. | 2 | (+) The footer has information links such as "About", "Site rules", and "Support". <br/>(-) Information about each specific tab is missing. | Add a small blurb either at the top or side of each tab, as a popup when hovering each tab, or as a section in the "About" tab, to describe its features.
