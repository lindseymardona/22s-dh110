### Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

# Project Description #
The goal of the quarter is to walk through the human centered design process with an emphasis in music and learning-related applications for middle-aged men. I believe that the opportunity to learn music should be something that is more openly available, and with online resources, this task becomes much easier. My intended focus is sites that enable musicians to learn songs more quickly and easily, such as sheet music sites and guitar tab sites. My objective is to explore possible ways to improve these available resources not only to maximize usability for users with varying levels of comfort with technology, but in an aesthetically pleasing way as well.

## About ##
Ultimate Guitar is a website where users can submit chord sheets, guitar tabs, ukelele tabs, bass tabs, and more. In addition to its main feature, it also offers additional functionalities for musicians and users to enjoy. The *Shots* feature allows users to submit videos of themselves playing. The *Courses* feature is a place for users to access and purchase published courses. The *Articles* feature is a place where music-related news is submitted. Finally, the *Forums* feature is where musicians can meet, interact, and hold discussion about any topic of their interest.

## Initial Overall Evaluation ##
At first glance, the site has its strengths and weaknesses. The simple interface makes it mostly pretty easy to navigate, and the tab pages are very straightforward. Visually, however, the clutter of ad placement on the landing page and the bright yellow accent color look slightly intimidating and somewhat oudated. The *Shots* page could benefit from scrolling functionality, and it also doesn't look cohesive to the rest of the site because of the blurred background. There can be more clarity in regard to which features require payment or a pro membership in order to access them. There should also be easier user access to understanding certain areas themselves, like the difference between each type of tab in the catalog, and redirects to how to read the tabs themselves for beginners.
