### Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

# Description #
At the most basic level, a prototype is simply an expression of how a design is intended to materialize. Building upon this, a low-fidelity prototype is a version of this expression in which the design elements are secondary to the most important and functional aspects of the design. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is create a low-fidelity prototype in order to begin conceptualizing how the user would interact with the redesigned website. This shall be done by sketching detailed wireframes, then using them to create a wireflow as an initial prototype. The information collected from testing this low-fidelity prototype will hopefully provide insight into the effectiveness of the prototype, as well as what areas still need improvement.

In order to develop the low-fidelity prototype, conclusions drawn from previously conducted [user research](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-03/contextual-inquiry.md) and the [personas + usage scenarios](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-04/persona.md) shall be used to make an informed choice about what to prioritize testing. 

## User Research ##

The summary of the user research is as follows:

- Ads should not be obstructing use of the site in order to limit clutter and confusion.
- Difficulty ratings of songs should be easily viewable, as well as standardized in some way.
- The process of viewing different versions of a song should be streamlined.
- Functionality that allows the MIDI of a song to be played back should be added to improve music learning capabilities.
- Both site usage and lyrics should be made available in different languages.
- The tab revision process should be simple and evident to the user.

## Personas + Usage Scenarios ##

From there, personas and their appropriate usage scenarios were developed, in which there was a focus on the following features:
- Simple and clear navigation, easy to use without a high level of tech literacy
- A free and trustworthy website without clutter or popups 
- Different ways of presenting and learning the music (namely: interactive tablature and chord sheets)
- A tool that is beginner-friendly while still promoting growth 
- Using Shots to share videos

## Tasks and Features ##

Thus, the tasks and features that have been selected for this low fidelity prototype are as follows:</br></br>
**Wireflow 1** </br>
- Search for a song
- Choose a different version of difficulty of the tablature from the sidebar
- Switch between tablature and a chord sheet

</br>**Wireflow 2**</br>
- Access the interactive tutorial for how to use Shots

# Wireframes #
There are two wireframe spreads that have been designed to illustrate Wireflow 1 and Wireflow 2, depicted below. The full sized pdf of the low fidelity prototype wireframes can be accessed [here](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-05/wireframes.pdf).

# Testing #
Testing was conducted with a test participant who is new to music learning in order to best test the wireframes. The instructions provided were not to explain the intermediate features ionvolved in executing the tasks. The tasks were explained as follows:</br></br>
**Wireflow 1 Task:**</br> 
- Find the "easy" guitar tab for "Happier" by Ed Sheeran. Then, find the chord sheet of the same song.

**Wireflow 2 Task:**</br> 
- Access the interactive tutorial for how to use the "Shots" feature.</br>
## Test Wireflow 1 ##

## Test Wireflow 2 ##

The participant was able to complete the task successfully without any confusion.

# Reflection #
Although it was tedious, I enjoyed thinking about how to design the wireframes effectively, particularly in order to address my goals of simplicity without clutter in order to have an interface that is welcoming to users who are not familiar with music and/or technology. I made additions and revisions to my wireframes several times throughout the process as I realized what needed to be implemented to better accomplish my prototype goals. I felt like this type of website was particularly challenging to design the low fidelity prototypes for in comparison to a music learning phone application, namely because with those kinds of applications, a lot of people can fall back on using a log in/sign up and introductory survey functionality to design. On the other hand, as also noted in the [user testing](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-03/contextual-inquiry.md), it's ideal to avoid a log in/sign up functionality for websites (and subsequently, a survey for user recommendation optimization), because people don't want to have to go through those steps simply in order to use the website.

I also realized after finishing that I could have added one more wireflow path, with clicking the "Ultimate Guitar" in the top left corner bringing the user back to the homepage.

The feedback I got from the wireflow test as well as how I would address it in a prototype revision is as follows:

**Feedback** | **Revision** 
-------------|--------------------
Organize artists by alphabetical order | Add sorting functionalities for search results (e.g. relevance, alphabetical, newest, etc.)
Functinoality to close "help" window should be implemented | Make it clearer as to how to close the "help" window as opposed to clicking outside of the box
Implement way to close tutorial while in progress | Add an overlayed X button to exit the tutorial in the top right corner of the grayed out screen
