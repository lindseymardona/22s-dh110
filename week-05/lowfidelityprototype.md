### Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

# Description #
At the most basic level, a prototype is simply an expression of how a design is intended to materialize. Building upon this, a low-fidelity prototype is a version of this expression in which the design elements are secondary to the most important and functional aspects of the design. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is create a low-fidelity prototype in order to begin conceptualizing how the user would interact with the redesigned website. This shall be done by sketching detailed wireframes, then using them to create a wireflow as an initial prototype. The information collected from testing this low-fidelity prototype will hopefully provide insight into the effectiveness of the prototype, as well as what areas still need improvement.

In order to develop the low-fidelity prototype, conclusions drawn from previously conducted [user research](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-03/contextual-inquiry.md) and the [personas + usage scenarios](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-04/persona.md) shall be used to make an informed choice about what to prioritize testing. 

## User Research ##

The summary of the user research is as follows:

- Ads should not be obstructing use of the site in order to limit clutter and confusion.
- Difficulty ratings of songs should be easily viewable, as well as standardized in some way.
- The process of viewing different versions of a song should be streamlined.
- Functionality that allows the MIDI of a song to be played back should be added to improve music learning capabilities.
- Both site usage and lyrics should be made available in different languages.
- The tab revision process should be simple and evident to the user.

## Personas + Usage Scenarios ##

From there, personas and their appropriate usage scenarios were developed, in which there was a focus on the following features:
- Simple and clear navigation, easy to use without a high level of tech literacy
- A free and trustworthy website without clutter or popups 
- Different ways of presenting and learning the music (namely: interactive tablature and chord sheets)
- A tool that is beginner-friendly while still promoting growth 

## Tasks and Features ##

Thus, the tasks and features that have been selected for this low fidelity prototype are as follows:
1. Search for a song
2. Choose a different version of difficulty of the tablature from the sidebar
3. Switch between tablature and a chord sheet
