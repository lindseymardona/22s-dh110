## Scenario ##
Bradley is a 35 year old chef from Jakarta, Indonesia. He has wanted to learn how to play the guitar since around the time he graduated from culinary school, but the culinary world is hectic, and he has had little time to pursue much else as he worked to pay the bills and fought to establish himself as a chef. Recently, he received the promotion he had been hoping for, and he's found that he has a little bit more spare time than he has had in a long while. One day, on his much needed day off, he is relaxing and browsing YouTube when a Sungha Jung video pops up on his YouTube homepage. It's been a while since he's seen one of his covers, and so he clicks on the video to watch it. After listening to Sungha Jung's beautiful rendition of the song, he feels reinspired to learn guitar, and because he has more free time on his hands now, he decides to pick up the guitar he bought years ago and finally start teaching himself guitar.

After watching some tutorials on technique and learning some basic chords, he decides it's time to try learning a song. Sungha Jung's rendition of Howl's Moving Castle is one of his favorite covers from him, and he wants to learn how to play it. However, as someone with no background in music whatsoever, he has a hard time picking things up by ear. Determined to start learning and practicing his first song, he looks for a resource online that might be able to help him. He wants a website that presents the actual music-learning resources in a simple way that is easy for a beginner to comprehend. Unfortunately, a lot of websites contain a lot of musician jargon that is difficult to understand for users who have never taken a formal music lesson. Additionally, many of the resources face other problems, such as a lack of non-mainstream repertoire, as well as unappealing and inconvenient ways of displaying guitar tablature, which become a barrier to beginning musicians. 

Finally, he finds Ultimate Guitar, which is supported by community-submitted tabs, presents the tabs in a visually appealing and convenient way, provides helpful music-learning user functionality (such as playback of the song, auto-scrolling, a metronome, and more), and even has multiple versions of songs so that beginning musicians have something digestible for them to learn, and can later even work their way up to harder difficulties. He goes to the search bar to look for Sungha Jung's Howl's Moving Castle and the tab pops up in the results. He clicks on the song, which leads him to a very intuitive guitar tab. He can see the difficulty ratings of and navigate between the different versions of the songs easily in the sidebar. A tutorial for reading tablature is also displayed under the 'Help' button. He goes through that tutorial first, and then he clicks on the easiest version of the tab. After practicing whenever he has time for months after that, he finally learns how to play the piece. This accomplishment inspires him to keep learning and improving, and because of his positive experiences, Ultimate Guitar becomes his primary tool for learning songs on the guitar after that.
