### Assignment 04: Persona + Usage 

# UX Storytelling #
When it comes to UX, it is crucial to remember at every stage in the process that its purpose is user-centered. The intent is to design a product in order to fill the needs of a wide range of users with different identities. This is where the purpose of UX storytelling comes in: to develop some specitic perspectives of users that may very well be using the product in question, and to be able to empathize with them and see things from their point of view so to better understand the various but specific needs of different users of the product. The insights that are learned from creating a persona and using empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps to better understand them, are ones that can continue to be kept in mind as the product is designed: because at the end of the day, the goals of the people the service is designed for aligns with the goals of the service itself. 

# Proposed Tasks #

## Task 1: Tablature Redesign ##
Further insights from the [contextual inquiry](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-03/contextual-inquiry.md) have raised the imminent issue of tablature on the Ultimate Guitar website being slightly archaic and difficult to understand for new users. By implementing a more modern way of visualizing tablature, it can make the process of learning music easier and less intimidating to even beginner musicians with no background in music. Information on how to read tablature should be very easily accessible. The implementation of visualizing this tablature comes with several simple baseline benefits: a more intuitive way to read the chords and the rhythms of the guitar, an automatic scrolling functionality, playback of programmed guitars demonstrating how the song should sound, and a built-in metronome. These additional tools should make practicing the music easier as well, so that users can improve efficiently. Additionally, as also addressed in the [usability testing](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-02/usability-testing.md), the tabs should also have a sidebar that displays different versions of the song and their difficulties to make finding music to learn more user- and beginner- friendly. These difficulties should be standardized so that the rating is slightly less arbitrary and subjective.

## Task 2: Basic Navigational Redesign + Tutorial ##
Usability problems identified in the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/lindseymardona/22s-dh110/blob/main/week-01/heuristic-evaluation.md) indicate a severe need for navigational aspects of the website to be redesigned. The purpose of this is to make using the website as intuitive as possible, especially for musicians who are not as comfortable with using technology, as well as minimize errors while trying to complete basic tasks. The specific features in question for this basic redesign are follows:
- It is a little bit hard to tell where the user currently is on the site. Highlight the tab that the user is currently accessing. Add a path at the top of the page (e.g. "Tabs -> Chords -> Ed Sheeran -> Perfect (ver 7)").
-  The Tab Catalog minimizes all other tab types when the user selects one. Instead of closing the other tab types, they should stay open while the specified tab type is highlighted. 
-  "Publish Tab" and "Pro" open into completely different page structures than the main site and don't provide a clear way to go back. Either maintain the page structure on the "Publish Tab" and "Pro" tabs, or open those in new browser tabs completely.
-  Change the yellow, which is harsh on the eyes, especially when there's lots of it. 
-  Tabs and functionality that are member- or subscription-locked are not indicated as such, prior to clicking on them. Add a symbol for tabs that are member-locked. 
-  The ad placement is distracting. Remove or minimize ad placements to improve trustworthiness and aesthetic simplicity of site, and reduce clutter.

Additionally, with the implementation of this redesign, a basic tutorial on how to navigate the site and look for tabs should be easy to access.

## Empathy Map ##

## Scenario ##
Bradley is a 35 year old chef from Jakarta, Indonesia. He has wanted to learn how to play the guitar since around the time he graduated from culinary school, but the culinary world is hectic, and he has had little time to pursue much else as he worked to pay the bills and fought to establish himself as a chef. Recently, he received the promotion he had been hoping for, and he's found that he has a little bit more spare time than he has had in a long while. One day, on his much needed day off, he is relaxing and browsing YouTube when a Sungha Jung video pops up on his YouTube homepage. It's been a while since he's seen one of his covers, and so he clicks on the video to watch it. After listening to Sungha Jung's beautiful rendition of the song, he feels reinspired to learn guitar, and because he has more free time on his hands now, he decides to pick up the guitar he bought years ago and finally start teaching himself guitar.

After watching some tutorials on technique and learning some basic chords, he decides it's time to try learning a song. Sungha Jung's rendition of Howl's Moving Castle is one of his favorite covers from him, and he wants to learn how to play it. However, as someone with no background in music whatsoever, he has a hard time picking things up by ear. Determined to start learning and practicing his first song, he looks for a resource online that might be able to help him. He wants a website that presents the actual music-learning resources in a simple way that is easy for a beginner to comprehend. Unfortunately, a lot of websites contain a lot of musician jargon that is difficult to understand for users who have never taken a formal music lesson. Additionally, many of the resources face other problems, such as a lack of non-mainstream repertoire, as well as unappealing and inconvenient ways of displaying guitar tablature, which become a barrier to beginning musicians. 

Finally, he finds Ultimate Guitar, which is supported by community-submitted tabs, presents the tabs in a visually appealing and convenient way, provides helpful music-learning user functionality (such as playback of the song, auto-scrolling, a metronome, and more), and even has multiple versions of songs so that beginning musicians have something digestible for them to learn, and can later even work their way up to harder difficulties. He goes to the search bar to look for Sungha Jung's Howl's Moving Castle and the tab pops up in the results. He clicks on the song, which leads him to a very intuitive guitar tab. He can see the difficulty ratings of and navigate between the different versions of the songs easily in the sidebar. A tutorial for reading tablature is also displayed under the 'Help' button. He goes through that tutorial first, and then he clicks on the easiest version of the tab. After practicing whenever he has time for months after that, he finally learns how to play the piece. This accomplishment inspires him to keep learning and improving, and because of his positive experiences, Ultimate Guitar becomes his primary tool for learning songs on the guitar after that.

## Scenario ##
Liam is a professional keyboard player from Nashville, Tennessee, USA. He has played gigs for years as a keyboardist with the rest of his band, and he often helps out other bands to play keyboard for them as well. Unfortunately, though he was once very on top of the music that was trendy (and thus would often be played for gigs), the music scene is changing faster than he can keep up. His bands will sometimes spontaneously pick out songs before and during the gig and pull chords from the Internet. He wants to be able to keep up with them and read from a lead sheet during gigs to improv off of, but he's not tech savvy at all, nor does he want to pay for a service he's already begrudgingly learning. 

Sometimes, if he knows he's playing a new song the night before, he'll write out a lead sheet by hand and slip it into his binder. Otherwise, if he needs to navigate a complicated site, he'll ask his son to help him find the lead sheet for him online and print it out. However, this is impractical as a gigging musician whose sets change frequently, so his son gifts him an iPad for Christmas. The problem is that he's consistently struggled with the sites that he's tried to use before for these purposes. They are often convoluted with unnecessary information and confusing interfaces that are unattractive. All he wants is something clean and simple that gives him what he needs: nothing more, nothing less. 

Some younger musicians recommended to him a website called Ultimate Guitar: it contains a large database of user-submitted chord sheets that he can reference and use with whoever he's gigging with that day. The interface is very straightforward, and the site navigation minimizes any possible confusion with its functionality. Its main functionality, which is chord sheets and tabs, are free to access, and the ads are not cluttering the site. He goes through the interactive tutorial available on their website, which shows him that he can go straight to the search bar, search for an artist or a song, and click the one he's looking for easily. It opens up to a guitar tab, but there is an option to select a lead sheet if that's what the user is looking for instead. He clicks on the lead sheet and displayed at the top is information about the key, difficulty, and more. The lead sheet is presented in a the way that is very similar to the way they used to be presented on paper: very clean and simple, simplistic, easy to ready, and without anything distracting. The lyrics are available so that he can follow along with the lead vocalist and/or provide backup vocals while he's improvising on chords. 

The intuitive design of Ultimate Guitar makes it so that Liam can learn how to use something that is hassle-free, and makes his life as a gigging musician much easier. He is finally able to conveniently pull up lead sheets within seconds so that the process of playing new songs can be streamlined into something that is nearly instantaneous, so he is able to keep up with the band he is playing with no matter what happens. His music is all in one place on his iPad, so he no longer has to carry binders full of paper, and he starts to feel a little bit more confident and self-sufficient because he is able to use an online resource without too much headache.
